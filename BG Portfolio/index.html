          <p class="lead">Why & how did I get to where I am today with code? During my breaks in college I worked
            in
            retail to have spending money while I was
            away at college and to go out with friends when I had the time. Sadly, at the end of each break I
            would
            count down the days until my last day
            came for that season at my retail job and it being over was always a huge relief. I majored in
            something
            I
            knew I would love doing as a career for
            the rest of my life so I wouldn't have these feelings of waiting for the last day of work to come.
            <br>
            Graduation comes and goes, I receive my Bachelors Degree in Digital Design and here I am currently
            working
            in a retail job,
            but this
            time I am not looking forward to my last day
            like the other times. Instead, I worked my way into a leadership role and found a passion for helping
            others
            grow and leading a team into success.
            I told myself that this is still not my vision for the rest of my life. I want to be involved with an
            industry that shapes the world, impacts the lives
            of others in positive ways and inspires others to do the same.
            <br>
            Being fascinated with how technology is growing and the impact it has on our everyday lives, I started
            to
            look into online computer science courses
            which were about teaching you the theory behind computer science. I felt like I was not getting
            exactly
            what I wanted from the courses. My brother and I spoke (who has a Bachelor of Science degree) and he
            told me
            to
            learn something called HTML and CSS because you could instantly see what you are
            creating and working on. This has now turned into
            a never ending "I want more" process and I find myself spending several hours a day constantly
            learning.
            My
            first month passes by and I uploaded my first website
            written in HTML and CSS from scratch and I felt like I had just taken over the world. Was it the best
            website ever created? Nowhere near but it was a step
            in the right direction of what is turning into a passion of mine. Along comes JavaScript and my
            progress
            slowed down a bit due to this overwhelming amount of
            information being thrown at me from different sources such as udemy courses, teamtreehouse,
            stackoverflow,
            etc. After grasping the basics of JavaScript, a
            little bit of jQuery , and familiarzing myself with Bootstrap, I had then realized, this is it! I have
            found
            what I love to do, and I am spending countless hours learning more and more, day by day, and
            building this better version of myself. Each day is becoming more addicting than the day before.
            <br>
            Moving forward now a couple months, and I completely re worked my first website, learned how to make
            it
            responsive to different screen sizes, and learned how to
            create a simpler UI, I am now taking more steps on this endless path of learning Front End Web
            Development
            and could not be more excited on what the world of code
            has to offer me.
